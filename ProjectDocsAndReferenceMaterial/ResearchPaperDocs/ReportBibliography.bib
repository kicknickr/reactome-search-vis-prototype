  abstract	= {Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and
		  peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One
		  of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient
		  access to its high quality curated data. At present,
		  biological pathway databases typically store their contents
		  in relational databases. This limits access efficiency
		  because there are performance issues associated with
		  queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same
		  data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently.
		  Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a
		  graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService
		  (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j
		  graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide
		  efficient access to the complex Reactome data model,
		  facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The
		  adoption of this technology greatly improved query
		  efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web
		  service built on top of the graph database provides...},

		  provides molecular details of signal transduction,

		  processes as an ordered network of molecular
		  transformations—an extended version of a classic
		  metabolic map, in a single consistent data model. Reactome
		  functions both as an archive of biological processes and as
		  a tool for discovering unexpected functional relationships
		  in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic

		  continued brisk growth in the size and complexity of
		  Reactome, we have implemented a graph database, improved
		  performance of data analysis tools, and designed new data
		  structures and strategies to boost diagram viewer
		  performance. To make our website more accessible to human
		  users, we have improved pathway display and navigation by
		  implementing interactive Enhanced High Level Diagrams
		  (EHLDs) with an associated icon library, and subpathway
		  highlighting and zooming, in a simplified and reorganized
